</noscript><h1>Vires Virtual Test Drive Addon</h1>
<p class="Body">This device allows the user to integrate Vires VTD into NI VeriStand.</p>

<p>VTD is a complete tool-chain for driving simulation applications. 
VTD is a toolkit for the creation, configuration, presentation and evaluation of virtual environments in the scope of road and rail based simulations. 
It is used for the development of ADAS and automated driving systems as well as the core for training simulators. 
It covers the full range from the generation of 3d content to the simulation of complex traffic scenarios and, finally, 
to the simulation of either simplified or physically driven sensors. It is used in SiL, DiL, ViL and HiL applications and may also be operated as co-simulations including 3rd party or custom packages. 
By its open and modular design it can easily be interfaced and integrated.</p>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<p>In order to communicate with VIRES VTD please specify the IP address of the machine, where VIRES VTD is running on.</p>
<h3>SCP Configuration</h3> 
<p>Configure Simulation Control Protocol (SCP) to control Vires VTD over.</p>
